# Space Tourism Website

A fully responsive, multi-page website with dynamic content and a modern, minimalist design.

## Description

This project is a solution to the "Space Tourism Website" challenge from Frontend Mentor. The main objective was to build a complete, multi-page website with a clean, futuristic design. This project is a great demonstration of combining **Tailwind CSS** for a fast and efficient styling workflow with **JavaScript** for essential interactive features, such as dynamic content loading and a responsive navigation menu.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For creating the semantic structure of each page, including navigation, sections, and dynamic content containers.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Used for all the styling. The modern, minimalist UI and the responsive layouts for all pages were built by composing Tailwind's utility classes.
* **JavaScript:** This is the core technology that handles the website's dynamic functionalities. It is responsible for:
    * The **interactive navigation**, which toggles the mobile menu on smaller screens.
    * The **dynamic content sections** (e.g., in "Destination," "Crew," and "Technology"), which update images and text based on user clicks without reloading the page.

## Installation

This is a static multi-page project. To get a local copy, simply follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/hangtime319/space-tourism-website.git](https://github.com/hangtime319/space-tourism-website.git)
    ```
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser and use the navigation to explore the different pages.

## Usage

This project serves as a showcase of a professional and fully-functional website. It features a main homepage, a destinations page with an interactive gallery, a crew page with a content slider, and a technology page with a content switcher. The design is fully responsive and optimized for a seamless user experience on all devices.

## Features

* **Dynamic Content:** Content (text and images) changes dynamically based on user clicks, handled by JavaScript.
* **Multi-Page Structure:** The site is composed of several well-structured HTML pages.
* **Responsive Navigation:** The menu transforms into a hamburger menu on smaller screens, offering a clean mobile experience.
* **Minimalist & Futuristic UI:** The design is modern, clean, and visually appealing.
* **Styling with Tailwind CSS:** The entire look and feel of the website were built using a utility-first approach.
